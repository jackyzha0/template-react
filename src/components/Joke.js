/*
Generally, it's a pretty bad idea to mix data with application behaviour.
Components should be pure, meaning they need to receive data to render it,
but they shouldnâ€™t know where the data came from, how it changes, or how to create it.
Containers provide a means for developers to wrangle data and pass it onto a component
to actually do the rendering. This component should be populated via the `DadJoke` container
found in `containers/DadJoke`
